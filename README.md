# Find And Seek - A python passion project

Find And Seek is a Python passion project completed to gain competency in Python and object oriented design and development. It brings together a passion for retail- specifically luxury retail- and technology.

This project was developed with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape websites for the luxury products and details, then built with [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/).

## Development

Some things to note to get started locally-

This project uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) to simplify environment variables and dependencies.

To Run the interactive shell-
```
pipenv shell
```

## Usage

Scraping/Getting data-
```
python manage.py getinitialdata -all
```
This command will scrape and initiate new classes for the business, designer, and site. (The flag can be updated for just the individual classes needed.)


Running the local server (now with coverage)-
```
coverage run manage.py runserver
```

## Production

[Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) is used to serve and deploy the production app.

To check out the latest production version of the app, it is currently found at [https://murmuring-reaches-12951.herokuapp.com/](https://murmuring-reaches-12951.herokuapp.com/). (Refined Heroku deployment coming soon!)
